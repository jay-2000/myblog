## Language

I have started learning Python by making some mini projects from scratch.
Following are the project which i made using python 3.

- [Quiz Game](https://github.com/jay-2000/lip.py/blob/main/quiz_game.py)

- [Number Guesser](https://github.com/jay-2000/lip.py/blob/main/number_guesser.py)

### Key takeaways

I got to learn string conversion(str()), print function, conditional statements(if, else), uppercaase & lowercase conversions(.lower , .upper).

Also got to know about the great use of while loop,elif statement, continue , Random module, and break and some basic concept.




Respect++ & Huge Shout outs to those who have completed their 100 days of code challenge.

If you are reading this blog and made it this far, THANK YOU SO MUCH for taking out the time to read my blog. Have a Great day.

Peace!
