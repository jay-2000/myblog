coding helps to improve the logic and language syntaxically start is pretty hard but not impossible. this is how i started with the help of some references and tutorial for 2nd problem

- [leetcode problem 509](https://github.com/jay-2000/lip.py/blob/main/leetcode/509.py)

### Key takeaways

I got to learn DSA(this 3 letters together and very dangerous) concepts.just check out the code you will get to know the topics that i tried to covered
