---

Today I was very happy since i received my DEV hackathon participant badge as well as few dollars credits to buy some DEV sticker goodies, as a token of appreciation for a successful submission as a participant.so TODAY I FELT LIKE TO DO SOME DEVELOPMENT RATHER THAN SOLVING A CODING PROBLEM.

## Multi-clipboard

With the help of different modules in python , I created a mini-project which helps to save data in json as a clipboard.for now the delete feature is not yet included but soon it can be so stay tune.

### Key takeaways

I got to learn modules like clipboard modules, system modules(sys) and one of the important one in development i.e. JSON module .
