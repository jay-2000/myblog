## Best way to learn Dev/code

The Best way to learn code is by doing it. So I am planning to learn 

- Web Dev
- DSA
  - Will try for leetcode as well as Hackerrank.
- some Devops tools

Their is something called **Learn in Public**, which help us to grow our career as a better _Software Engineer_, and which the help of
[GitHub](http://github.com) , which is a Remote Version control system , we can easy showcase our work as well as our learning.

### It needs Time

Unfortunately I was unable to complete my previous 100 Days of Code Challenge due to some Health/personal issue.

But this time I will do it

> Coding and Development goes hand in hand  
> You cannot skip any of them if you want to be an Elite SDE
> and Remember nobody is too late to start.

Respect++ & Huge Shout outs to those who have completed their 100 days of code challenge.
