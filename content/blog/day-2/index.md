## Language/concept/topic

so, Basically I have made a rock-paper-scissors game and an adventure game.

- [rock paper scissors](https://github.com/jay-2000/lip.py/blob/main/rock_paper_scissors.py)

### Key takeaways

I got to learn and revised new things as well as concepts. elif, random module, while loop, basic use of list, break & continue keywords.

Respect++ & Huge Shout outs to those who have completed their 100 days of code challenge.
